     * Algorithm:
     * 1. Create a set of edges (will be used to keep trace of remaining edges)
     * 2. Pop the first edge from the set if not empty
     * 3. Push this edge to the result
     * 4. Find the next edge, from the set, that is connected to the current one. An edge is considered as connected if:
     *    - the `to` point of the current edge is the `from` point of the next edge
     *    - the `to` point of the current edge is the `to` point of the next edge. In this case the edge is reversed
     * 5. Push this edge to the result, remove it from the set, define as current edge, and go to step 4
     * 6. If no edge is found, go to step 2 (handle disconnected paths)
     * 7. When the set is empty, the algorithm is finished, so return a new instance of Path with the fixed edges
